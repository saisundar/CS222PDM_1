# ScratchDB
A Top-to-Bottom Database system, with beta cli, with B-Tree indexing - all from scratch. (No external libraries)

This database uses your disk as the datastore. 

It features a full blown page-manager, an index-manager( uses B-Tree indices built from scratch, with lazy deletion), a table manager, and a query layer.
